Brilliantly blue waters combined with sandy beaches are what call park visitors to play, fish, boat, and camp here at Bear Lake State Park. Minerals (calcium carbonate) suspended in the lake’s waters are what help create its spectacular aqua-blue color.

Located in the beautiful Bear Lake Valley in Rich County, there are three distinct recreation areas: Marina, Rendezvous Beach, and the Eastside, which offer a variety of recreational opportunities. Whether you plan on spending a day, weekend, or more, Bear Lake offers some of the best picnicking, camping, boating, fishing, or hiking that you will find in the great state of Utah. For more information on the three areas of Bear Lake, please check out our Facilities page.

So come to take a break with us and enjoy some time in the great outdoors that is the beautiful natural resource known as Bear Lake State Park.


DISCOVER
Bear Lake was formed 28,000 years ago by earthquake activity. At an elevation of 5,923 feet, Bear Lake is 20 miles long and eight miles wide, 208 feet deep, and covers 112 square miles.

Originally Bear Lake was called Black Bear Lake by Donald Mackenzie, an explorer for the North West Fur Company who discovered it in 1819 while scouting for fur-bearing animals. The name was later changed to Bear Lake.

WHY IS IT SO BLUE? Its beautiful and unique green-blue color is the result of calcium carbonates suspended in the lake.

Bear Lake State Park – Rendezvous Beach is named for the famous rendezvous of fur trappers and Indians held in the summers of 1827 and 1828. A thousand or more Native Americans and mountain men – including Jedediah Smith – attended the gatherings. There were so many campfires at the south end of the lake at these trading sessions that one observer called the area “a lighted city.”

East Side areas of Cisco Beach, South Eden, North Eden, Rainbow Cove, and First Point: These improved, but primitive areas are located on the east side of the lake and are four to twelve miles north of Laketown. The terrain is rocky and the water depth drops off quickly to 208 feet.

Cisco Beach is famous for its midwinter fishing with dip nets for the small, seven-inch Bonneville Cisco, a member of the whitefish family.  For 10 days to two weeks at the end of every January, swarms of Cisco come close to the rocky shore to spawn. They are easily scooped up by hardy fishermen wading waist-deep in the icy water or through holes in the ice if the lake is frozen.

Cisco Beach is also known for excellent inland water scuba diving opportunities. The rocky bottom and the steep drop-off close to shore make this location a favorite of divers from the tri-state area.

Opened to the public as a state park in 1962.

Park Elevation:  5,930 feet.

Welcome to Escalante Petrified Forest State Park!

Camp along the shores of Wide Hollow Reservoir, swim or rent a kayak or paddleboard to play and explore on its clear waters. Hike along park nature trails through a petrified forest, but remember to take only photographs. Some say the petrified wood is haunted and removing a piece brings the taker nothing but bad luck. Watch this and decide for yourself!

Make sure you click the “More Conditions Information” button to the right for more about the park.

Here are some videos of the campground and up on top of the Petrified Forest Trail.

In 1872, a member of John Wesley Powell’s survey party, Almon Harris Thompson, first explored the Escalante River. He decided to name the area after an explorer named Escalante, which means to escalate upward, like stair steps, which describes the plateaus surrounding the park.

In 1954, Wide Hollow Reservoir was constructed to provide irrigation for the town of Escalante. The reservoir is stocked with rainbow trout and bluegill and is popular for water sports.

A visitor center was built in 1991 and features petrified wood, petrified dinosaur bones, ammonite, and shell fossils.

Visitors will enjoy several trails, which wind throughout the park. The Petrified Forest Trail is a one-mile loop, winding through lava flows and thousands of pieces of petrified wood. The Sleeping Rainbows trail is an optional .75-mile loop off the Petrified Forest Trail. This section is much steeper and requires scrambling and climbing over rocks.

In the fall of 2014, they added a 50 ft petrified tree. The entire tree can be viewed from its roots to the tip. it is accessible to all visitors.

Opened to the public as a state park in 1976.

Park Elevation: 5,900 feet

Welcome to Otter Creek State Park

This quiet getaway is a great destination for ATV riders, boaters, and birders. Access three ATV trails, including the Paiute Trail System, directly from the park. Lure a record catch from Otter Creek Reservoir, a prime fishery. Go birding during spring and fall as many bird species through the park on their journey along the Pacific Migratory Bird Flyway.

In the fall of 1897, construction began on one of the oldest dam projects in Utah, creating what is now Otter Creek Reservoir. Local Mormons in the area needed a source of irrigation water for farming in the area where they had chosen to live. Many of the farmers had experience with building irrigation canals but knew nothing about constructing a dam. After applying for water rights, members of the Otter Creek Reservoir Company were denied the financial assistance they needed to take on the project.

Despite the lack of funds to build the dam, it was decided to go ahead and begin construction. Robert Dixon Young, who had no prior experience in dam construction, was appointed supervisor of the project. With the help of local volunteers and homemade equipment, construction began in 1897. A year later, financial assistance was finally approved and the proper equipment to complete the project was purchased.

Once the 40-foot-high dam was complete, state engineers described it to be “one of the best and more secure earth reservoir dams in the country.” The original dam structure held up very well over many years, although some recent improvements have been made by the state.

Otter Creek Reservoir has become famous for quality fishing. It contains Rainbow, Cutthroat, and Brown Trout as well as Smallmouth Bass and Wipers.

Otter Creek State Park was constructed on the south end of the reservoir and opened to the public as a state park in 1965. Many improvements have been made over the years. Whether you are into fishing, hunting, OHV riding, birding, hiking, and many other outdoor activities, Otter Creek State Park offers you a location to start any adventure. Our campground has over 50 sites (21 of those have electric and water hookups) as well as a group-use pavilion perfect for gatherings and reunions. We now have 2 cabins for rent that can each sleep 6 people. Modern restrooms with individual showers are also located in the park. During our summer season, we offer rentals on fishing boats, canoes, paddleboards, and mountain bikes.
